Welcome to HyperTrace!

HyperTrace is a rust-agent powered system monitor, with a python backend and visualisation in Grafana. Implemented with gRPC to be super quick.

For the next iteration, it would be interesting to turn it into a mini EDR agent which could get log files and then create some detection logic and alerting based on suspicious behaviour.
